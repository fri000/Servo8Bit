/*

  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo8Bit class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method


  The methods are:

   Servo8Bit - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Attiny pins.

   attach(pin)           - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
   attach(pin, min, max) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
                           default min is 544, max is 2400

   write()               - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
   writeMicroseconds()   - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds
   read()                - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180.
   readMicroseconds()    - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds.
   attached()            - Returns true if there is a servo attached.
   detach()              - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
